## Overview 
A browser-based Snake game built to practice front-end development, focusing on keyboard control, movement, collision detection, and random number generation.

## Features
- Keyboard control of snake movement. 
- Tracking of current score and high score (stored locally).
- Fruit spawning in random locations. 
- Bonus `Golden Fruit` with expiration timer. 
- Collision detection and game-over state.

## Technologies
- ReactJS (Vite)
- TailwindCSS

## Installation
- Ensure Node.js is installed (v16+ recommended).
- Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
- Run `npm run dev` to launch app locally.

## What I Learned
- Managing snake and fruit positions with useState. 
- Capturing keyboard input for movement direction with useState.
- Checking for collision upon movement.
- Use of Math.random() to create randomised fruit positions.
